# JackGiotto's 2024 Advent of Code solutions

My first attempt at the Advent of Code. Tried to solve the problems in C++, used also as an excerise for "_Programming I_" class.

So i tried (mostly for the first few days) to solve them without too many libraries, the reading of the files was done with _fstream_, same used in the class.

Miserably stopped at the second part of day 17. Maybe one day i'll come back to it.

_Stats.sh_ is a script to do benchmarking of compile and running times done with _hyperfine_.
